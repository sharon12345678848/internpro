                  Our mission is to create a sustainable solution where surplus food can be donated to those in need. 
                  We connect generous donors with orphanages and charitable homes, ensuring that no food goes to waste 
                  and every meal counts. By reducing food waste and providing for the less fortunate, we strive to make 
                  a meaningful impact on our community."
